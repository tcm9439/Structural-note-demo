# Demo for Structural Note

This is a static online demo page for my project [Structural Note](https://github.com/tcm9439/Structural-note). It shows the major function of the note editor with default note templates.

**Note**
- Don't go the root `index.html` or `setting/index.html` directly, they will not work in this demo / by its own. Use the link above as the entry point and only navigate around by the UI. 
- The file-related functions (save, load, export, etc.), window-related functions and shortcut will not work in this web-based demo.
